### Updating Textures

To update the texture files in Forever Indev, follow these steps:

1. **Locate Texture Files:**
   - Texture files are found in `lib/client/minecraft.jar`.

2. **Extract the Texture Files:**
   - Extract the contents of `minecraft.jar` to the directory `/lib/client/minecraft`.

3. **Update the Textures:**
   - Make the necessary changes to the texture files in the `/lib/client/minecraft` directory.

4. **Rezip the Contents:**
   - After updating the textures, rezip the contents of the `/lib/client/minecraft` folder.

5. **Rename the Zipped File:**
   - Rename the newly created zipped file to `minecraft.jar`.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the structure of the folder and files remains unchanged during the extraction and rezip process.
- Any errors in the folder structure or file names can cause the game to fail to recognize the updated textures or even crash due to missing files.
