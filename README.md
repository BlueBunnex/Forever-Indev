### Updating Textures

To update the texture files in Forever Indev, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to `minecraft/jars/deobfuscated.jar` within the project.
2. Extract the contents of `deobfuscated.jar`.
   - Within the newly extracted folder, you will find all the texture files that you can edit.
   - **Unzip jar on Mac**: `unzip deobfuscated.jar -d FOLDERNAME`
3. After updating the textures, rezip the extracted folder back into `minecraft/jars/deobfuscated.jar`.
   - **Rezip jar on Mac**: `jar cvf deobfuscated.jar -C FOLDERNAME/ .`

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the structure of the folder and files remains unchanged during the extraction and rezip process.
- Any errors in the folder structure or file names can cause the game to fail to recognize the updated textures or even crash due to missing files.
