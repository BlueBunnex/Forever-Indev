## Updating Textures

To update the texture files in Forever Indev, follow these steps:

1. **Locate Texture Files:**
   - Texture files are found in `lib/client/minecraft.jar`.

2. **Extract the Texture Files:**
   - Extract the contents of `minecraft.jar` to the directory `/lib/client/minecraft`.

3. **Update the Textures:**
   - Make the necessary changes to the texture files in the `/lib/client/minecraft` directory.

4. **Rezip the Contents:**
   - After updating the textures, rezip the contents of the `/lib/client/minecraft` folder.

5. **Rename the Zipped File:**
   - Rename the newly created zipped file to `minecraft.jar`.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the structure of the folder and files remains unchanged during the extraction and rezip process.
- Any errors in the folder structure or file names can cause the game to fail to recognize the updated textures or even crash due to missing files.

Enjoy exploring Forever Indev!
